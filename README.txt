Here are some monte carlo simulations that
I have completed as a part of my coursework.

portfolio (C) is a simulation over a 14 year period
of a portfolio of 70% equities and 30% bonds.
depends on the GNU Scientific Library.

queue (C++11) is a simulation of units flowing through a
business process with a single queue and a single
processor (or resource)

walk (C) simulates the path taken by an inebriated man wandering
the streets.
