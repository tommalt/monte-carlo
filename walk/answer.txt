$ ./walk
Iterations			: 10000
P(within two blocks from store) : 0.4847
Average blocks walked           : 7.1170
Average distance from store     : 2.5349

We can test the validity of our simulation by noting that the
average blocks walked should be:
	1 + 9 * 0.68 = 7.12
because he always walks on the first minute, thus we are left with
9 minutes and the probability of walking, 0.68
